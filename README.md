<h3 align="left">About Me:</h3>
<p align="left">
Currently studying to be a Software Engineer, I work as a Data Scientist, where I have extensive experience in system integration and data analysis in different business sectors. My career includes large process automation projects, using APIs and Python with a focus on web scraping libraries, HTTP requests, handling large spreadsheets, inserting data into different databases, and filling out web forms. I also configure Windows Server services, such as network services (IIS, TCP/IP, Firewall) and background software applications such as Docker for container orchestration.

In addition, I have theoretical knowledge of the AWS database and have extensive experience with the configuration and administration of the SQL Server database, including data security rules with best practices that I have acquired over time. It is worth mentioning some AI/ML integrations for database interpretation and analysis, providing insights and rapid analysis.

Additionally, I use Power BI to create interactive dashboards, aiming to raise relevant indicators and minimize the use of resources, applying business rules and optimizing integration with the data source from ETL flows.
